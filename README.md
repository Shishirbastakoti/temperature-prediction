# Temperature Prediction

## ðŸ“š Description

This project aims to predict temperatures using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset of Nepal's daily climate data from 1981 to 2019 to train and test the model.

In this project, a linear regression model is used to train the data and predict temperatures. The predicted values are then compared with actual data to evaluate the model's accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saimondahal/nepal-daily-climate-1981-2019).
